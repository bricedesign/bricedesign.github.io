<p>Books for Cooks – Notting Hill’s famous cookbook shop located just off London's Portobello Road – was founded in 1983 and acquired in 2001 by the current owners Rosie Kindersley and Eric Treuillé. They commissioned General&nbsp;Practice Design Consultants, where Ian Brice was a partner, to redesign and refurbish the entire premises.</p>

<p>Ian worked closely with Rosie and Eric, replanning the small ground floor bookshop and its popular test kitchen to improve customer flow, and project managing the refit of the bookshop and kitchen interior and units, the shopfront, and the demonstration kitchen and office on the floors above.</p>
