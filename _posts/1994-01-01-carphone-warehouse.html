<p>Whilst working at Godsmark Gordon, Ian Brice and his late colleague – the highly talented and much loved and missed Hamilton Godsmark – were recommended to Charles Dunstone, Managing Director of <a href="http://www.carphonewarehouse.com">The Carphone Warehouse</a> who then owned two shops.</p>

<p>Hamilton and Ian produced and implemented the design concept for a new shop and then, over the next five years, project managed the roll-out of 180 branches throughout the UK and in Paris, increasing their team to twelve strong in order to do so.</p>

<p>During this exhilarating yet challenging period, they saw The Carphone Warehouse grow from a small business to a major force in retailing, with landlords vying to gain them as anchor tenants, and some retail park developers erecting bespoke buildings to Godsmark Gordon’s design.</p>
