<p>Brice Design Consultants were approached by established clients to design and project manage the extension and refurbishment of this Victorian house set in a conservation area.</p>

<p>Though permitted development rights would have allowed a 3 metre rear extension, Ian Brice successfully applied for planning permission for a 4 metre addition.</p>

<p>Ian Brice designed bespoke oak and painted cabinetry throughout: a kitchen, island and larder with Carrara marble worktops, and bookshelves and cupboards to offices and the utility room. Original features were retained and restored, and two salvaged Victorian corbel chimneypieces fitted.</p>

<p>The majority of the work, by main contractor <a href="http://www.eatongate.co.uk">Eaton Gate</a>, was at lower ground floor level. This was completely stripped-out – including most interior walls and the rear exterior wall – and a steel frame, a concrete slab and underfloor heating installed. The Structural Engineer was CSE Consulting. A minimal structural glass extension was added by <a href="http://www.glasspace.com">GlasSpace</a>, introducing light and opening up views from the front of the house to the end of the garden.</p>

<p>In the en suite master bathroom an existing shower was clad in Carrara marble and a full height frameless glass screen was added. A new bathroom was created on the second floor and Aston Matthews fittings were installed throughout.</p>
