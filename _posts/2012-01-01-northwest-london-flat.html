<p>Brice Design Consultants were recommended by longstanding clients to the owners of this North London flat in an 1879 building with a fascinating history. They had recently acquired the premises and had detailed intentions for its refurbishment, which Ian Brice helped them realise.</p>

<p>Ian Brice produced working drawings and applications for submission to the freeholders and to Building Control, and liaised with those bodies to obtain approvals. He negotiated the contract sum with <a href="http://www.eatongate.co.uk">Eaton Gate</a> – the preferred main contractor – and oversaw the work, chairing all site meetings.</p>

<p>In the living and dining room an inappropriate, weak, reproduction Georgian fire surround was replaced by a handsome neo-Gothic chimneypiece and firegrate from <a href="http://www.westlandlondon.com">Westland London</a>.</p>

<p>The lighting and electrical layout was supplemented and rationalized, with digital lighting controllers added in main rooms. Panel radiators were replaced with column models more in keeping with the building and some underfloor heating was installed. The flat was redecorated throughout in Farrow &amp; Ball paints.</p>

<p>The kitchen was completely stripped-out and refitted with bespoke walnut cabinets and Marron Cohiba granite worktops, and a Bateig Blue limestone floor. The cabinets concealed all heating and hot water plant – some hidden by tall wine racks –which proved something of an engineering challenge. A dedicated mobile device charging drawer doubles as a laptop desk.</p>

<p>Subtle yet substantial alterations were made to the positions of partitions and doors to improve the efficiency of the layout and to maximize storage space. Additional, matching cupboards were fitted above existing wardrobes. Floor finishes were taken up and walnut boards, stone and carpet laid.</p>

<p>The master bathroom was also gutted and new cabinets, sanitary fittings and Scala Blue limestone cladding installed throughout.</p>

<p>In the study, bespoke bunk beds capable of accommodating adults take advantage of the tall space by including filing drawers, one hiding a secret step for grandchildren.</p>
