<p>Publishers and environmental campaigners Peter and Juliet Kindersley commissioned Alec French Architects to design a highly sustainable eco conference centre for Sheepdrove Organic Farm in Berkshire – one of the largest in the country – and General Practice Design Consultants, where Ian Brice was a partner, to design the interiors of the farm shop, restaurant and open kitchen.</p>

<p>They also designed and specified joinery – made by Benchmark – furniture and eco-friendly finishes to other spaces throughout.</p>
